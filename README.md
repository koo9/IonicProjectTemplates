# IonicProjectTemplates

This project's goal is to bring .Net devs (Visual Studio lovers) closer to Ionic Framework by providing Project Templates that can be installed in Visual Studio by installing the extension. This will allow them to use the power of the Visual Studio Tools for Apache Cordova while getting a ready Ionic Project.

In this GitHub project there is a Visual Studio Solution with 6 projects: 5 Ionic Project Templates and the Extension project.
